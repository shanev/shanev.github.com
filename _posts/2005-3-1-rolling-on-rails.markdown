================

Well, the post below worked.  I literally was able to make web posting work in under 10 minutes using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>.  This is truly a great web framework.  Rails is perfect for those who follow Agile methodologies, as you can start with an auto-generated scaffold and gradually improve (refactor) your design.  I can see this being used as a prototyping tool for a large-scale J2EE or .NET project.

Rails fills a gap that has existed in web frameworks for a long time.  You have J2EE which is geared towards the most complex projects, and then you have server side scripting which can be used for simpler projects.  Rails fits right in the middle, which I believe satisfies the requirements of a majority of the projects out there.
