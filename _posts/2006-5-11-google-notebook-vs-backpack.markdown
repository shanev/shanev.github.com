title: Google Notebook vs. Backpack
---
I just read the announcement of [Google Notebook](http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/new_tech.html).  This sounds awfully like Backpack with a Firefox plugin component.  A plugin can easily be created now using the [Backpack API](http://www.backpackit.com/api/).  However, with the nice little Ajax touches in Backpack, I honestly don't even see a need for a browser component.
