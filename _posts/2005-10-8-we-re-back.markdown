Wow! Its been **_seven_** months since my last post.  So why the long hiatus? First of all, my HD crashed during a long Bittorrent download.  Great.  As expected, Windows didn't have a clue how to deal with this except to prompt me that I have a hardware failure every 2 minutes.  Ofcourse this had to happen during the most convenient time.  I had just accepted a new job offer, was in the process of selling my car and buying another one, and was shopping around for a new apartment.

So only now are things getting back to normal.  But we're back (my blog and I) with style, running on FreeBSD with Lighttpd and the newest Typo trunk! I also finally switched my dev box to a Mac! I'm completely, 100% Windows free!

This new version of Typo is pretty cool, but what happened to being lightweight? It has certainly come along way since I contributed my little del.icio.us sidebar.  I think it was the 2nd or 3rd patch ever submitted.  The new admin interface is slick, but a little too heavy on the Ajax IMHO.  Remember the mantra of the guys that helped build Rails, "Less is More", or I think ["Less is Better"](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_is_more_is_bullshit.php) is what they are using now.  Anyway, its great to see so many people participate in open source.  People can only learn and get better from the experience.
