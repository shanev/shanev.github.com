*Shane Vitarana*

I own and operate [CrimsonJet](http://crimsonjet.com), an iPhone app company.  CrimsonJet's most successful product, [Drum Kit](http://www.getdrumkit), was the #2 [best selling music app](http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2008/12/02/apple-announces-top-10-iphone-app-downloads-of-2008/) in the iTunes App Store in 2008 and continues to be in the Top 10 in Music.  It has been featured in Apple's TV ads, billboards, and posters.

I started programming at age 14, before the Internet was mainstream.  The first programming language I learned was [PPL](http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/language-ppl-562.html) \(now defunct\) to write plugins for the "BBS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system I operated out of my parents house.  I was lucky to attend a middle school that taught BASIC and a high school that had a course in Pascal.  Since then I've taught myself C, Java, Ruby, and Cocoa Touch.  I've authored and contributed to many [open source projects](http://github.com/shanev), most within the Ruby community, and written a book on [Facebook development](http://peepcode.com/products/rails-on-facebook).

During college at Rutgers University, I mainly focused on the hardware side, and got a dual degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.  Later I got my M.S at Illinois Institute of Technology, focusing on electromagnetics and nanotechnology.

In my former life, I did software development for some big companies, including Merrill Lynch, Motorola, and Orbitz.  However, I always wanted to start my own company since the early days of college.  I left Orbitz in April 2007 and founded CrimsonJet, doing Ruby on Rails consulting.  I quit my consulting gigs in March '08, the day Apple announced the iPhone SDK.  I knew the iPhone was going to change the mobile landscape for a long time and wanted to be part of that process.

Sorry, I'm not available for iPhone development.
