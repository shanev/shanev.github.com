title: RailsConf 2007 Notes
---
All my notes from the RailsConf sessions are [here](http://shanesbrain.net/pages/sessions.txt).  They don't contain everything from the sessions I attended, just mostly things that were either new to me or were of some importance.  O'Reilly put up most of the presentation slides on [their site](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/51/presentations.html).  Does anyone have notes on Uncle Bob's Clean Code presentation? The one on the O'Reilly site is Java-specific.  He didn't do a Java talk at RailsConf did he?

If anyone was at Dante's on Saturday night, and took pictures of the [Exta Action Marching Band](http://www.extra-action.com/), I'd love to see them.
