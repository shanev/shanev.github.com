title: SwitchTower ---> Capistrano
---
[What?](http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/articles/2006/03/06/switchtower-renamed) Sounds like an Italian pasta dish.  I guess [Distribulator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/distribulator/http://sourceforge.net/projects/distribulator/) was already taken.  I'm still going to call it SwitchTower.  I'm starting a boycott.
