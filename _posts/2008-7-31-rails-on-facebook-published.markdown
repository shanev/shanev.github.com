I'm happy to announce the publication of my first PDF book, [Rails on Facebook](http://peepcode.com/products/rails-on-facebook), along with co-author [David Clements](http://shortpath.blogspot.com/).

> "This 67 page PDF will get you up and running with the Facebooker plugin. You'll learn to install and configure the plugin. You''ll send HTML, Javascript, and images to Facebook (with caching). You''ll learn about the parts of Facebook that you can augment. Finally, you''ll learn how to write tests for your Facebook application".  --Peepcode Press

Like all [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com/) books, there's no fluff here.  Just straight ahead how to make a Facebook application using Ruby on Rails.  David and I made sure it covers the latest API additions and changes.
