bq. "This 67 page PDF will get you up and running with the Facebooker plugin. Youâ€™ll learn to install and configure the plugin. Youâ€™ll send HTML, Javascript, and images to Facebook (with caching). Youâ€™ll learn about the parts of Facebook that you can augment. Finally, youâ€™ll learn how to write tests for your Facebook application".  --Peepcode Press

Like all "Peepcode":http://peepcode.com/ books, there's no fluff here.  Just straight ahead how to make a Facebook application using Ruby on Rails.  David and I made sure it covers the latest API additions and changes.
