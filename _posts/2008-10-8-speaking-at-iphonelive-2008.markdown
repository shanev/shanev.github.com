I'm going to be speaking at "iPhoneLive 2008":http://en.oreilly.com/iphonelive2008 in San Jose, on November 18th, O'Reilly's new conference for iPhone developers.  Now that the NDA has been lifted, this conference is going to be a chock full of information.  The "line-up":http://en.oreilly.com/iphonelive2008/public/schedule/speakers looks amazing, and includes some of the best speakers from "iPhoneDevCamp":http://www.iphonedevcamp.org/ and "C4":http://rentzsch.com/c4/2schedule.

I'm going to talk about criteria for successful iPhone apps, and about the Audio APIs available in the SDK.
