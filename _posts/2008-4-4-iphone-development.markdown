================

For those who are [following me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/shanev), it's quite obvious that I've been playing with the iPhone SDK for the past couple of weeks.  I'm taking the next 2-3 months off of client work just to build out some iPhone apps.  I have list of 30+ ideas but will focus on a handful of them and hopefully get them ready by the time the App Store launches in June.

I'll be posting some video demos of app prototypes soon.  Stay tuned.
