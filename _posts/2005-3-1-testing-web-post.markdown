title: Testing Web Post
---
This is a test post to see if web posting is working.  For those who have been left in the dark, this blog is being powered by a new open source blogging tool named "Typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com, which I contribute to.  Typo follows the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle, and thus does not come with an online posting mechanism.  It is made to work with existing XML-RPC based clients.  Unfortunately it currently seems to work best with the Mac client MarsEdit, and I am running a PC.  So I attempted to hack together a quick and dirty web posting system.  This is better work otherwise this post would be wasted energy.
