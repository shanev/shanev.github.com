title: New Crop of Web Calendars
---
I first talked about calendars in my post [Tada Calendar](http://www.shanesbrain.net/articles/2005/03/02/tada-calendar) back in March 2005.  It seems that a few other people got the same idea probably around the same time, with the recent announcements from [30boxes](http://www.30boxes.com) and [SpongeCell](http://www.spongecell).

One thing I noticed in all these new calendar apps is the heavy use of popup dialogs.  I just don't believe dialog windows have any place in future web apps.  The nature of the web as a page within a browser calls for a different interface than a desktop.   I don't think simply mimicking a desktop calendar is the right approach.  Gmail manages to be better than a desktop email client without any dialogs.  I think with some creative ideas, the same concepts can be applied to a calendar.
