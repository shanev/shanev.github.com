Why is this the second post? Well, because I accidently set the development database equal to the production database in the "Typo":http://typo.leetsoft.com/ database configuration file, and ran "Rake":http://rake.rubyforge.org/, which is the version of Makefile or Ant for Ruby.  Rake clears the database before running tests, and my first post got wiped off the face of this planet.  

I recall writing something about not having the brain capacity to deal with the enormous amount of information I am acquiring on the web, and that how some type of record keeping, via blogging or whatever, is needed to supplement my brain storage abilities.
