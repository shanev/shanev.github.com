================

So it just finished, and I already can't wait until next year.  The talks ranged from very general to very specific and were all pretty solid.  My favorite general talk was [AC/DC, Stravinsky, & Rails](http://railsconf.org/talks/selected/show/131 ) by Adam Keys.  I was psyched for this one, since, although not a huge fan, I appreciate AC/DC's [Keep It Simple Stupid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle  ) approach to music, and also because I took a Stravinsky class in college.  One point I thought he'd mention though, is how Rails is like Stravinsky on the inside, and like AC/DC on the outside, exposing a domain-specific language that is simple and follows tried-and-true conventions.

My favorite specific talk was [Rails Deployment](http://railsconf.org/talks/selected/show/155 ) by Ezra Zygmuntowicz.  I think Ezra has discovered the way to make Rails apps truly scalable, and I think I need to jump on the Mongrel bandwagon.  I wanted to wait until it was a bit more stable.  I'm a little hesistant to run a beta application server, but I just haven't heard any complaints about Mongrel.  

I also thought [MetaRails](http://railsconf.org/talks/selected/show/99 ) by Stuart Halloway was very beneficial to those curious about the inner workings of Rails.  I was also blown away by Bryan Wood's demo of [Lendmonkey.com](http://www.lendmonkey.com), a media trading community developed by one guy, except for the logo.

**Update**: Cool, Adam [appreciates](http://mvm.therealadam.com/articles/2006/07/12/remnants) my insight.
