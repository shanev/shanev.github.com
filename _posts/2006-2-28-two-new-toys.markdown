================

I'm getting two new toys this week:

![Macbook Pro](http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2006/02/14/macbook_pro_1.jpg "Macbook pro")

 ![Roland V-Tour](http://www.sweetwater.com/images/items/TD6S-large.jpg "Roland V-Drum")

Both are arriving on the same day.  Which one should I play with first?

How do I justify these? Well, I _need_ the Macbook because it allows me to be mobile while working on my Rails side projects.  But staring at the screen for hours on end is bad right? Thats why now I'll be able to go hammer on the drums every once in a while. But since I'll be away from home on my Macbook, I won't be able to play the drums.  Whatever.... I'm getting both anyway.
