title: Finally Made the Plunge
---
I did it.  I'm no longer a full-time Java developer.  At nearly 2.5 years of doing Rails part-time, I'm practically an old-timer.  Many of you who started learning Ruby and Rails around the time I did have had much success doing freelance work.  I'm happy to announce the creation of CrimsonJet, LLC., which will provide Agile, test-driven Rails development solutions. 

I also hope to introduce a few web apps that I have been working on for the past few months and step up my open-source contributions.  Check out my [RailsConf plan](http://myconfplan.com/users/shanev/conferences/RailsConf2007) and definitely get in touch with me if you want to meet up in Portland.  

More real content coming soon.  Watch this space! :)

Side note: I am not anti-Java or pro-Ruby (okay fine, maybe a little).  I believe in using the right tool or mix of tools for the job.  For far too long people have been using sledge-hammers to drive in push-pins.
