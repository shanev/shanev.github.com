[Video Jukebox](http://apps.facebook.com/jookbox/) finds music videos of your favorite music and lets you put them on your profile.

You must have the favorite music section in your profile filled out for Video Jukebox to figure out what you like.

This uses a pre-release version of [youtube-g](http://rubyforge.org/projects/youtube-g/), a Ruby API for the [GData](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/overview.html) version of YouTube's API.

Thanks to [Walter Korman](http://lemurware.blogspot.com/) for brainstorming the idea with me and Jesus Duran for help with the name.
