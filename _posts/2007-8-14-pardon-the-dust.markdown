title: Pardon the Dust
---
I recently migrated this blog from Typo to Mephisto and have a few cleanup activities to perform.  Markdown formatting has to be converted, sidebar stuff has to be added, and the design needs some minor tweaks to get things looking like how they did before.  So sorry for the temporary ugliness.

I've been really busy working on client projects and trying to get my own startup launched, and therefore have been falling behind on the open source work.  Thanks to those who sent me contributions to the youtube gem.  I plan on making one more release before working on version 2.  youtube2 will use the GData format since YouTube is changing the API to fit more with Google's other APIs.  It is slated for release later in the year.
