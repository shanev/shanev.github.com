title: MacBook, Whats in a Name?
---


I really donâ€™t like the new name of Appleâ€™s first Intel notebook. Powerbook just sounds so much cooler, why change the name? I believe this is an attempt by Appleâ€™s marketing department to strengthen the Mac brand. Iâ€™m not a marketing expert, but I believe Apple has way too many sub-brands in its hardware line, which can confuse newcomers. iBook, PowerBook, iMac, Power Mac, which is the right one for me?

Is a PowerBook a Mac? Believe it or not, some people might not know this. Calling the new notebook a MacBook puts it right in the name. Now the average consumer does not need to associate â€œPowerBookâ€ or â€œiBookâ€ with â€œMac.â€ I think Apple tried to move in this direction with the â€œiâ€ prefix brands, so people would know iAnything was an Apple product.

Which is better, an iBook or a PowerBook? Standardizing on MacBook and MacBook Pro will settle the issue.

I still donâ€™t like new name, but Iâ€™m sure it will grow on me as I subconsiously get bombared with ads. Lets hope there wonâ€™t be a MacPod.
