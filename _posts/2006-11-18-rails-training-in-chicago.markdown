title: Rails Training in Chicago
---
The guys over at [Softies on Rails](http://www.softiesonrails.com/) are doing a one-day [Rails training event](http://www.http://www.softiesonrails.com/softiesonrails.com/2006/10/30/the-web-developer-s-makeover-registration-open) in Chicago on January 13th.  They are limiting it to only 20 seats to foster a more intimate setting and charging only $249 a head.  It is targeted mainly at people coming from a .NET background.  If you fit the profile and have been curious about Rails, be sure to check it out as it is sure to sell out.
